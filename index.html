                            <p>
                                Elizabeth Green is a devoted wife of 23 years and proud mother of five, whose life 
                                has been shaped by love, family, and faith. A natural storyteller, Elizabeth has 
                                been writing since childhood, finding healing and purpose in her words.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She is the author of Unspoken Goodbyes: A Daughter's Story of Grief, Love, and Healing, 
                                a deeply personal memoir that reflects her resilience in the face of grief and her 
                                commitment to helping others navigate their own journeys of loss.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When she isn't writing, Elizabeth can be found singing, cherishing time with friends, 
                                or pouring into her community at Rush Creek Green Oaks in Arlington, Texas. Known for 
                                her authenticity and heart for others, she believes in the power of connection — whether 
                                through words, music, or simply showing up for the people around her.

                                    Elizabeth Green is a devoted wife, mother, "Gammy," and a storyteller at heart. She carries both tenderness and tenacity in everything she does. Her father was her hero, her protector, and her greatest cheerleader.

                                    When he passed, the grief that followed became the foundation for this memoir. Unspoken Goodbyes: A Daughter's Story of Grief, Love, and Healing was born from heartbreak but rooted in hope.

                                    Through these pages, Elizabeth invites readers into her journey of grieving, remembering, growing, and ultimately rediscovering joy. Surrounded by meaningful friendships, heartfelt conversations, and the love of her ever-expanding family, she has learned to live with a deep sense of purpose.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She believes in laughing often, loving boldly, and writing bravely. In honoring her father—who, like a mighty oak, stood tall in love and grace—Elizabeth shares her story with the hope that it helps you feel seen in your own.

                                <p>Elizabeth is currently working on her next book, ProdaGal – From a Mother's Point of View. This unique Bible study draws inspiration from the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11–32).</p>
                                
                                <p>While Scripture focuses on the father and his two sons, Elizabeth invites readers to imagine the story through the eyes of a mother—what her prayers, worries, and hopes might have been as she watched her child wander and return.</p>
                                
                                <p>This reflective study offers encouragement, biblical insight, and a tender perspective for parents walking through their own seasons of waiting, heartache, and hope.</p>

                            Life brings seasons of joy, growth, and also deep challenges. Whether I'm walking with someone through grief, helping them find clarity, or supporting them in their personal growth, my heart is to remind you that you don't have to go through it alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through grief counseling, life coaching, and personal development services, I offer guidance and encouragement to help you move forward with strength, hope, and purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're carrying something heavy, I'd love to hear from you. You can use the prayer request form or the contact form to share what's on your mind. Whether you're looking for guidance, encouragement, or simply someone to listen, I'm here to walk alongside you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
